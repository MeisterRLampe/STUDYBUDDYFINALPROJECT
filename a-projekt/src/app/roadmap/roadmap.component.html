        Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for having lesser implementation dependencies. It is a computing platform for application development. Java is fast, secure, and reliable, therefore. It is widely used for developing Java applications in laptops, data centers, game consoles, scientific supercomputers, cell phones, etc.

              Testing

              A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

            <div>
              Backend development deals with the technologies responsible for storing and securely manipulating user data.

              It is the part associated with all the hidden logic that powers the applications users interact with.

              Backend is considered the server-side part of an application.

              Backend is all the hidden inner workings and the behind-the-scenes processes in a web application.

              It refers to everything going on underneath the hood and all the necessary components that make the front-end function properly and smoothly.

              It makes sure everything is working optimally.

              Essentially, the backend is what the users don't have direct access to or don't directly interact with and are most likely unaware of when using an application.

            <div>
              Spring is an open-source framework that provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. The core module of Spring, also known as the “Spring Core” module, is at the heart of the framework and provides the fundamental functionality for dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC). In addition to dependency injection, the Spring Core module also provides several other features, such as:

              A flexible and extensible validation framework
              A type conversion system
              A consistent messaging framework

              You can learn more about Spring Core from the links below:

              <div>
                Design patterns are general solutions to common problems that arise in software development. They provide a way to describe and communicate proven solutions to common design problems and they provide a common vocabulary for design. They are not specific to any particular programming language or technology, but rather describe the problem and the solution in a way that can be applied to many different contexts.

                There are several different types of design patterns, including:

                Creational patterns
                Structural patterns
                Behavioral patterns
                Architectural patterns

                MySQL is an incredibly popular open source relational database management system (RDBMS). MySQL can be used as a stand-alone client or in conjunction with other services to provide database connectivity. The M in LAMP stack stands for MySQL; that alone should provide an idea of its prevalence.

            <div>
              The frontend is everything a user sees and interacts with when they click on a link or type in a web address. The web address is also known as at URL, or Uniform Resource Locator, and it tells what webpage should load and appear in your browser.

              It is the client-side part of a web application.

              <div>

                Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments.

                Thymeleaf's main goal is to bring elegant natural templates to your development workflow — HTML that can be correctly displayed in browsers and also work as static prototypes, allowing for stronger collaboration in development teams.

                With modules for Spring Framework, a host of integrations with your favourite tools, and the ability to plug in your own functionality, Thymeleaf is ideal for modern-day HTML5 JVM web development — although there is much more it can do.

              HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used on the frontend and gives the structure to the webpage which you can style using CSS and make interactive using JavaScript.

                JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It lets us add interactivity to pages e.g. you might have seen sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, etc on different websites — all of that is built using JavaScript. Apart from being used in the browser, it is also used in other non-browser environments as well such as Node.js for writing server-side code in JavaScript, Electron for writing desktop applications, React Native for mobile applications, and so on.
